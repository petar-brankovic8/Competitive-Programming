# [Codeforces Round 265 (Div. 2) C. No to Palindromes!](https://codeforces.com/contest/465/problem/C)

- time limit per test: 1 second
- memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

### Problem statement

Paul hates palindromes. He assumes that string s is tolerable if each its character is one of the first p letters of the English alphabet and s doesn't contain any palindrome contiguous substring of length 2 or more.

Paul has found a tolerable string s of length n. Help him find the lexicographically next tolerable string of the same length or else state that such string does not exist.

### Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers: n and p (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; 1 ≤ p ≤ 26). The second line contains string s, consisting of n small English letters. It is guaranteed that the string is tolerable (according to the above definition).

### Output

If the lexicographically next tolerable string of the same length exists, print it. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).
